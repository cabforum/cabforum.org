### Max validity of CS certs (Ian) – proposal

Ian sent out a proposal to the list to shorten validity down to 460 days, rather than xx months to keep it clear. Effective date proposed for May 30th. A short discussion was had if we can move this to the middle of the month. Ian will update the proposal effective date to June 15th.

### Fall elections: Vice Chair nomination (Tom Zermeno)

Voting period in progress at the moment. Voting looks good right now.
 
### Other business

Bruce – We still need to review ballots from other working groups. We should make sure we don’t fall out of sync too much. Bruce offered to send out an email with all ballots that have passed so we can review. 
 
### Next meeting – November 14th

Proposed to cancel the November 28th meeting as it is a public holiday in the US.
