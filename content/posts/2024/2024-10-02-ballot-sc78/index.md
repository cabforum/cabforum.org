## Ballot Contents

The TLS Baseline Requirements currently state an OV certificate may contain either a DBA / Assumed Name or Legal Name. The EVGs and SBRs allow for the common format of "DBA (Legal Name)". This ballot aims to align the practices for OV certificates with this. 

While still allowing the inclusion of the sole DBA / Assumed Name, it will also allow for the "DBA (Legal Name)" format to be used, allowing CAs to align practices with the EVG and SBRs.
 
The following motion has been proposed by Martijn Katerbarg (Sectigo) and endorsed by Clint Wilson (Apple) and Enrico Entschew (D-Trust).


### Motion begins

MODIFY the "Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certificates" ("Baseline Requirements") based on Version 2.0.7 as specified in the following redline:
