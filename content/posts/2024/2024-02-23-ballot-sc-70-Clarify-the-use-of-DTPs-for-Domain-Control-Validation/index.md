## Ballot Contents

### Purpose of the Ballot

This ballot aims to clarify the existing language around the use of delegated third-parties during domain and IP address control validation. It leaves the existing language in place, and adds specifics for the cases of DNS queries, WHOIS lookups, and contact with the Domain Name Registrat or IP Address Registration Authority.

Additionally, it places these same restrictions on CAA checking, with an effective date of 2024-05-15.

This ballot is proposed by Aaron Gable (ISRG / Let's Encrypt) and endorsed by Mads Henriksveen (Buypass) and Dimitris Zacharopoulos (HARICA).
