## Ballot Contents

### Purpose of the Ballot

This ballot proposes updates to the Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted TLS Server Certificates related to weak and compromised private keys. These changes lie primarily in Section 6.1.1.3:
•	6.1.1.3(4) clarifies that, for the purpose of this requirement, CAs shall be made aware of compromised keys using their existing notification mechanism(s).
•	6.1.1.3(5) improves guidance for CAs around the detection of weak keys. Should this ballot pass, these changes become effective on November 15, 2024.
Notes:
•	This ballot builds on the extensive work done by SSL.com in creating ballot SC-59v2 Weak Key Guidance. SSL.com’s contributions are appreciated.
•	Thanks to Rob Stradling of Sectigo for the generation and publication of the set of Debian weak keys referenced in this ballot.
•	The Debian weak keys requirements have been discussed extensively, including in the following threads: https://lists.cabforum.org/pipermail/servercert-wg/2024-March/004291.html and https://lists.cabforum.org/pipermail/servercert-wg/2024-April/004422.html 
•	This ballot does not appear to conflict with any other ballots that are currently under discussion.
