## Ballot Contents

This ballot duplicates the content of section 7.1.2.10.5 (CA Certificate Certificate Policies) into section 7.1.2.2 (Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificate Profile) as section 7.1.2.2.6 (Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificate Certificate Policies), modifying the requirement from "MUST contain exactly one Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier" to "MUST include at least one Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier. If any Subscriber Certificates will chain up directly to the Certificate issued under this Certificate Profile, this Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificate MUST contain exactly one Reserved Certificate Policy Identifier". This change allows the inclusion of multiple Reserved Certificate Policy Identifiers in a Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificate, except when any Subscriber Certificates chain up directly to the Certificate issued under this Certificate Profile.
 
Additionally, the description of the `policyIdentifier` contents was updated for clarification in both sections.
 
The following motion has been proposed by Paul van Brouwershaven (Entrust) and endorsed by Ben Wilson (Mozilla) and Thomas Zermeno (SSL.com).
