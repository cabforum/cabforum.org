## Discussion

### GitHub open issues

450 - Agreed to close issue

451 - Without browser support, CA/B allowance isn’t meaningful. Browser resources are more focused on post-quantum cryptography currently. Firefox may have support for ed25519, however (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1804788).

452 - While a normative change, should not have any actual impact given contributing requirements and aligns well with most similar definitions in e.g. RFC 5280. Agreed to address in a future clean-up ballot.

453 - Has already been addressed; agreed to close issue.

456 - The phrase “hosting service relationship” is unclear, both in its meaning and intent. Ben clarified that this something partially addressed in SC-071, but it was intended to provide stipulations or coverage where multiple parties are involved in the procurement of certificates. Agreed to wait on the results of SC-071 to pursue this issue further.

457 - Agreed to address in future clean-up ballot.

458 - Discussion confirmed this is still an issue which should be addressed, with potentially multiple areas that should be improved. Changing ‘Applicant’ to ’Subscriber’ had no objection. Altering the interaction between a domain name not being renewed and this requirement that associated certificates be revoked had rough consensus that it can be removed, but further discussion and confirmation (along with a specific proposal) would be the next step. One option would be to simply remove the second and third examples from sub-bullet 9 in Section 4.9.1.1 and to break up the sentence a bit more. Aaron’s proposed language on the issue (https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/issues/458#issuecomment-2318208466) had no objections and seemed to achieve rough consensus of being included in a future clean-up ballot.
