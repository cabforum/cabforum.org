## Ballot SMC010: Introduction of Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration 

### Summary: 

This ballot adopts Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration (MPIC) for CAs when conducting Email Domain Control Validation (DCV) and Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) checks for S/MIME Certificates.  The Ballot adopts the MPIC implementation consistent with the TLS Baseline Requirements.  

Acknowledging that some S/MIME CAs with no TLS operations may require additional time to deploy MPIC, the Ballot has a Compliance Date of May 15, 2025.  Following that date the implementation timeline described in TLS BR section 3.2.2.9 applies.

This ballot is proposed by Stephen Davidson (DigiCert) and endorsed by Ashish Dhiman (GlobalSign) and Nicolas Lidzborski (Google).
