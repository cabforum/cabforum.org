## Maximum validity of code signing certs
* worked on by Ian; he's a bit behind on that, hopes to get it into GitHub before Thanksgiving holiday 
* no comments on the ballot

## Email from Bruce Morton (Entrust) 10/31/24 
* aligning the code signing BRs with SCWG BRs 
* Cory evaluated the ballot concerns 
* Ballot SC-73 - has some value with CSCWG
* Ballot SC-75 - Pre-Sign linting - there is no linting created for CS at this time.
* Ballot SC-76v2 -OCSP requirements - Microsoft removed their requirements.  Martijn feels like we could follow the ballot; Corey agrees that the 15-minute rule has some value to Code Signing.  There’s lots of pre-cert language in the ballot that does not relate to Code Signing.
* Ballot SC-77 - Update Web Trust Audit name in Section 8.4 and references - already addressed
* Ballot SC-78 - Subject organizationName - Martijn is checking to see if there are CS issues
* Ballot SC 79v2 - allow more than one certificate policy - not relevant in CS environment.
* Martijn mentioned a desired logging ballot; and will update the list with it, later.

## Other business 
* New Chair starting 12/1/24 - Martijn and new Vice Chair Thomas
* No meeting on 11/28 for Thanksgiving – Martijn will lead the meeting on 12/12; need to set new hosts for the WebEx meeting.     
* Dean gave a great farewell speech, and we all thanked him for his great service to the CSCWG
