## Ballot Contents

### Purpose of the Ballot

There have been numerous compliance incidents publicly disclosed by CAs in which they failed to comply with the technical requirements described in standards associated with the issuance and management of publicly-trusted TLS Certificates. However, the industry has developed open-source tools, linters, that are free to use and can help CAs avoid certificate misissuance. Using such linters before issuing a precertificate from a Publicly-Trusted CA (pre-issuance linting) can prevent the mis-issuance in a wide variety of cases.

The following motion has been proposed by Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA and endorsed by Corey Bonnell of Digicert and Ben Wilson of Mozilla.


### Motion begins

MODIFY the “Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted TLS Server Certificates” based on Version 2.0.5 as specified in the following redline:
