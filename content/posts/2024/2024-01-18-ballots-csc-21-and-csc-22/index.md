### Purpose of the Ballot

This ballot updates the “Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly‐Trusted Code Signing Certificates“ version 3.4 in order to clarify language regarding Signing Service and signing requests. The main goals of this ballot are to:

1. Remove references to High Risk Certificate Request, since the CSBRs do not provide any actions for a high risk application.
1. Remove references to High Risk Region of Concern, since the CSBR appendix has never been populated.
1. Remove rules for a Takeover Attack to require the Subscriber to generate keys in a crypto device, since crypto device key generation is now a baseline requirement for all code signing certificates.
1. Remove option to transfer private key which has been generated in software.
1. Cleanup to remove Subscriber key generation option which expired effective 1 June 2023.
1. Cleanup to remove “any other method” to verify the Subscriber key was generated in a crypto device, since this option expired 1 June 2023.

The following motion has been proposed by Bruce Morton of Entrust and endorsed by Tim Hollebeek of DigiCert and Ian McMillan of Microsoft.
