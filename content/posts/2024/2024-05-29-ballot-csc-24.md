1.	Require Private Keys  associated with newly issued Timestamp Authority Subordinate CA to be stored in offline HSMs
2.	Require newly issued Timestamp Certificates to be issued from a TSA CA with its Private key storedn in offline HSMs
3.	Add a requirement to remove Private Keys associated with Timestamp Certificates after a 18 months
4.	Add a requirement to reject SHA-1 timestamp requests

The following motion has been proposed by Martijn Katerbarg of Sectigo and endorsed by Bruce Morton of Entrust and Ian McMillan of Microsoft.
