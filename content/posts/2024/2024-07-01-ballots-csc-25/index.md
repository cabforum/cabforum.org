### Purpose of the Ballot

This ballot updates the “Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly‐Trusted Code Signing Certificates“ version 3.7 in order to clarify language regarding Timestamp Authority Private Key Protection. The main goals of this ballot are to:
1.	Import all CSBR references that point to the EV Guidelines with the actual language of corresponding sections of version 1.8.0 of the EV Guidelines, in order to remove external dependencies.
2.	The Code Signing Working Group decided not to import rules related to the subject:organizationIdentifier field.

The following motion has been proposed by Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA and endorsed by Martijn Katerbarg of Sectigo and Corey Bonnell of Digicert.

### Motion

MODIFY the “Baseline Requirements for the Issuance and Management of Publicly‐Trusted Code Signing Certificates” ("Code Signing Baseline Requirements") based on version 3.7 as specified in the following redline: <https://github.com/cabforum/code-signing/compare/d431d9104094f2b89f35ed4bf1d64b9a844e762b...d5af6d895b3666b5351509ad25d47ac5e87321fc>
