## Additional Information (not part of Ballot)

## Bylaws v1.9

**5.3.1 Formation of Chartered Working Groups**

(e) CWGs may establish any number of subcommittees within its own Working Group to address any of such CWG’s business (each, a “Subcommittee”). A CWG-created Subcommittee needs to be approved by the CWG itself according to the approval process set forth in the CWG charter, but approval of the Forum is not necessary. Subcommittees must exist under an approved CWG.

## Ballot 203: Formation of Network Security Working Group (v2)

Purpose of Ballot: To form a Network Security Working Group to re-evaluate the CAB Forum’s Network Security Guidelines.

The following motion has been proposed by Gervase Markham of Mozilla and endorsed by Jeremy Rowley of DigiCert and Moudrick Dadashov of SSC:

# Motion begins

In accordance with Section 5.3 of the CA/B Forum Bylaws, the chartering of a new Working Group requires a ballot. This ballot charters the Network Security Working Group.

The CAB Forum’s Network Security Guidelines were adopted in August 2012 but have not been updated since. Significant doubts have been raised as to their fitness for purpose in 2017. Therefore, the Working Group’s charter will be as follows:

Scope

1. Consider options for revising, replacing or scrapping the Network Security Guidelines.

Deliverables

1. A report with one or more proposals for the future of the Network Security Guidelines.

1. For proposals involving replacement, details of the availability and applicability of the proposed alternative, and what modifications if any would be needed to it in order to make it suitable for use.

1. For proposals involving revision, details of the revisions that are deemed necessary and how the document will be kept current in the future.

1. For proposals involving scrapping, an explanation of why this is preferable to either of the other two options.

1. If there are multiple proposals, optionally a recommendation as to which one to pursue and an associated timeline.

1. A form of ballot or ballots to implement any recommendations.

Expiry

The Working Group shall expire once the deliverables have been completed, or on 2018-06-19, whichever happens first. The expiry date given above shall be automatically postponed by 1 year on 2018-05-19 (“postponement date”) and each anniversary of the postponement date thereafter unless three or more members separately or jointly request on the Public Mail List, within one month prior to a particular postponement date, that expiry of this Working Group not be postponed in that instance.
