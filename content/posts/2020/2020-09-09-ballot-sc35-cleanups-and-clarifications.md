## Relevant Bylaw references

Bylaw 2.3(f) requires:

– a “yes” vote by two-thirds of Certificate Issuer votes and 50%-plus-one Certificate Consumer votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both Certificate Issuers and Certificate Consumers.
– at least one Certificate Issuer and one Certificate Consumer Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was also met.

Under Bylaw 2.3(g), “a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated”. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting was **10**, so quorum was **11** votes – quorum was met.”

## Purpose of Ballot

This ballot attempts to fix the numerous typographical and editorial issues that have been identified in the SCWG documents (“spring cleanup”), such as incorrect section references, expired effective dates, or spelling and grammatical mistakes. Additionally, it attempts to provide guidance and clarification for language that has been viewed as ambiguous, multiple, or conflicting interpretations.

CAs SHOULD carefully review each change, to ensure no normative impact upon their CA operations and practices that may have resulted from these ambiguities and consistency issues.

The following motion has been proposed by Ryan Sleevi of Google and endorsed by Ben Wilson of Mozilla and Doug Beattie of GlobalSign.
