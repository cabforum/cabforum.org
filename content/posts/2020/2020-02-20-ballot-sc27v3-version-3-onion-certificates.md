## Ballot Results

The voting period for Ballot SC27v3 has ended and **the Ballot has Passed**. Here are the results:

## Voting by Certificate Issuers – 15 votes total including abstentions

– 0 **No votes**:
– **0 Abstain**:

100% of voting Certificate Consumers voted in favor.

## Relevant Bylaw references

Bylaw 2.3(f) requires:

– a “yes” vote by two-thirds of Certificate Issuer votes and 50%-plus-one Certificate Consumer votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both Certificate Issuers and Certificate Consumers.
– at least one Certificate Issuer and one Certificate Consumer Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was also met.

Under Bylaw 2.3(g), “a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated”. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting was **10**, so quorum was **11** votes – quorum was met.”

## Ballot SC27v3: Version 3 Onion Certificates

## Purpose of Ballot

This ballot will permit CAs to issue DV and OV certificates containing Tor onion addresses using the newer version 3 naming format.
In ballot 144, later clarified by ballots 198/201, the Forum created rules for issuing EV certificates containing onion addresses. A primary reason for requiring EV level validation was that onion addresses were cryptographically weak, relying on RSA-1024 and SHA-1. More recently a newer “version 3” addressing scheme has removed these weaknesses. For much the same reason that EV certificates are not always a viable option for website operators (e.g. sites operated by individuals), many onion sites would benefit from the availability of DV and OV certificates for version 3 onion addresses.
The Tor Service Descriptor Hash extension required in the EV Guidelines to contain the full hash of the keys related to the .onion address is no longer needed as this hash is part of the version 3 address.

Older version 2 onion addresses are still in use, so this ballot does not remove the existing EV Guidelines requirements for onion names.
