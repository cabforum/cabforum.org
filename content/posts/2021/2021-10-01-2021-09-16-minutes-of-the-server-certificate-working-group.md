Dean Coclin read the roll.

### 3. Review Agenda 

No changes were made to the agenda.

### 4. Approval of minutes from last teleconference 

The minutes from the last call were approved without changes.

### 5. Validation Subcommittee Update 

Ryan Sleevi said that the subcommittee met last Thursday. Tim Hollebeek said that he would follow up with the Infrastructure subcommittee on emailing digest summaries of GitHub activity to the list. That would not have helped with the draft certificate profiles since they are being edited in a different repository, so there was a request to continue reflecting decisions to the mailing list.

Ryan said that the bulk of the call was spent discussing technically constrained subCAs and what the BR definition is. This was a continuation of a discussion that began on the mailing list. The definitions section, and sections 7.1.5 and 8 of the BRs contain elements of this definition. The questions revolved around what subCAs issued by in-scope roots are in-scope for the BRs, and what data signed by those subCAs are in-scope?

### 6. NetSec Subcommittee Update 

Clint Wilson said the subcommittee met on Tuesday. Clint was elected as the new chair. The subcommittee is trying to reassess what was in flight and what work should continue forward and how. Two existing ballots are Clint’s and should move forward shortly. The first is to remove section 4.1.1, and the other updates the audit logging and records archival sections. A third ballot on the usage of “zones” in the NCSSRs was also discussed during the meeting and then on the list. At a more strategic level, looking at how to approach changes to the NCSSRs. There is interest in looking at the scope of the Network Security Subcommittee and considering a recharter to ensure that future work is in scope.
