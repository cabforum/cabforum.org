Bylaw 2.3(f) requires:

– at least one Certificate Issuer and one Certificate Consumer Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was also met.

Under Bylaw 2.3(g), “a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated”. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting was **12**, so quorum was **13** votes – quorum was met.”

The following motion has been proposed by the Server Certificate Working Group Chair Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA.
