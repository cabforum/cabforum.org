## Bylaw Requirements

1. Bylaw 2.3(f) requires:

o A “yes” vote by two-thirds of Certificate Issuer votes and by 50%-plus-one of Certificate Consumer votes. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose.
_This requirement was MET for Certificate Issuers and MET for Certificate Consumers_.

o at least one Certificate Issuer and one Certificate Consumer Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted.
_This requirement was MET_.

2. Bylaw 2.3(g) requires that a ballot result only be considered valid when “more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated”. Votes to abstain are counted in determining quorum. Half of the currently active members at the start of voting was 14, so the quorum was 15 for this ballot.
   _This requirement was MET._

This ballot now enters the IP Rights Review Period to permit members to review the ballot for relevant IP rights issues.

## Purpose of Ballot

Ballot 202 set out to clarify requirements regarding encoding of domain names and IP addresses in Subscriber Certificates, but the Ballot ultimately failed to pass. Since then, there have been numerous differences in interpretation of the written requirements.

This Ballot seeks to resolve these differences in interpretation and to provide unambiguous guidance on the correct encoding of domain names and IP addresses in Subscriber Certificates.

The following motion has been proposed by Corey Bonnell of DigiCert and endorsed by Ryan Sleevi of Google and Dimitris Zacharopoulos of HARICA.

## Motion Begins
