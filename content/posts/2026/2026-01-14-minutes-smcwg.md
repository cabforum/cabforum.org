## 6. Discussion
 
  * The WG discussed two ballots underway at the Server Certificate Working group.  It was agreed that text should be inserted in the S/MIME BR to maintain equivalency with SC96.  Stephen Davidson shared a proposal at https://github.com/cabforum/smime/issues/298.  Changes for SC94 were not considered necessary.
 
  * The WG revisited the subject of the user of clientAuth for SMTP-to-SMTP authentication.  Stephen asked for assistance in determining the scale of adoption of such certificates.  Andy Warner noted that he was seeking data.
 
  * Stephen presented a draft ballot https://github.com/cabforum/smime/compare/be9a18ab2b48eb0cbff41d3a268202f700c06c05...a4d2a8abcd43abe3ec8c5a6cb27cf4f3f97a4f51.  Scott Rea noted that some of the changes were unnecessarily explicit as they restated the requirements of the ISO standard being quoted. Stephen agreed to redraft. It was agreed to move the change relating to XX country code to a standalone ballot.  Ben Wilson previously agreed to endorse the mDL ballot.  Scott Rea tentatively agreed to endorse, subject to updates being made.
