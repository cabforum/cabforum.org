**Ballot SC-52 version 2: Specify CRL Validity Intervals in Seconds**

This ballot expired before entering the voting period.

**Purpose of Ballot:** Similar to Ballot SC-31 which modified the specification of

OCSP validity periods to be in seconds, this ballot modifies the specification

of CRL validity periods to be in seconds to avoid confusion about exactly which

periods are valid and which are not. The ballot also specifies that other time

periods should be handled the same way, which has broader impacts throughout

the document.

These changes should not be interpreted as implying that missing a deadline by

a few seconds is any more or less important than it previously was. The

changes are merely intended to provide additional clarity and precision about

exactly where the deadlines are.

The following motion has been proposed by Tim Hollebeek of DigiCert and endorsed

by Trevoli Ponds-White of Amazon and Kati Davids of GoDaddy.
