**Relevant Bylaw references **
Bylaw 2.3(6) requires:

a “yes” vote by two-thirds of Certificate Issuer votes and 50%-plus-one Certificate Consumer votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both Certificate Issuers and Certificate Consumers.
at least one Certificate Issuer and one Certificate Consumer Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was also met.
Under Bylaw 2.3(7), “a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated”. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum.
19 member companies attended the last teleconference, and quorum was updated accordingly. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting was **9**, so quorum was **10 votes** – quorum was met.

**Ballot SC21**: To Revise a Final Maintenance Guideline – the Network and Certificate Systems Security Requirements section 3.e. to allow for continuous, automated monitoring; edit section 3.f. to improve wording, and add section 3.g. to establish a response time for automated alerts.

Purpose of Ballot

The Network and Certificate System Security Requirements committee is proposing this ballot to revise the current requirements to better allow for automation and continuous monitoring of systems. The goal of this ballot is to remove manual efforts that can be less effective and more resource-intensive than automated monitoring and alerting.

This ballot also adds specific requirements in terms of the timeliness for addressing alerting from automated monitoring and alerting to ensure the implementation of automation does not increase the length of time that a potential issue could go without being detected.

It is proposed by Ben Wilson of DigiCert and endorsed by Trevoli Ponds-White of Amazon and Fotis Loukos of SSL.com to revise the Network and Certificate System Security Requirements (Requirements) as set forth in the following language of Section 3 of the Requirements, to be EFFECTIVE ninety (90) days after completion of the IPR Review Period:

\*- BALLOT BEGINS -\*

e. Monitor the integrity of the logging processes for application and system logs through continuous automated monitoring and alerting or through a human review to ensure that logging and log-integrity functions are effective. Alternatively, if a human review is utilized and the system is online, the process must be performed at least once every 31 days.

f. Monitor the archival and retention of logs to ensure that logs are retained for the appropriate amount of time in accordance with the disclosed business practices and applicable legislation.

g. If continuous automated monitoring and alerting is utilized to satisfy sections 1.h. or 3.e. of these Requirements, respond to the alert and initiate a plan of action within at most twenty-four (24) hours.

\*- BALLOT ENDS -\*

The procedure for approval of this ballot is as follows:

Discussion (7+ days)

Start Time: 19:00 UTC, Thursday, September 19, 2019

End Time: 19:00 UTC, Thursday, September 26, 2019

Immediately following the conclusion of the discussion period, one of the above proposers/endorsers will announce commencement of the 7-day voting period and will re-post this ballot in accordance with Bylaw 2.4.3.

If this ballot passes, then an IPR Review Period will occur in accordance with Bylaws 2.4.5 and 2.4.6.
