**Relevant Bylaw references **
Bylaw 2.3(6) requires:

a “yes” vote by two-thirds of Certificate Issuer votes and 50%-plus-one Certificate Consumer votes for approval. Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both Certificate Issuers and Certificate Consumers.
at least one Certificate Issuer and one Certificate Consumer Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was also met.
Under Bylaw 2.3(7), “a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated”. Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum.
20 member companies attended the last teleconference, and quorum was updated accordingly. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting was **10**, so quorum was **11 votes** – quorum was met.

## Ballot SC23 V3 – Precertificates

**Purpose of Ballot:**

This ballot intends to clarify requirements placed on Precertificates in BR section 4.9.10.

During a lengthy discussion on the mozilla.dev.security.policy forum \[1\], it was discovered that BR section 4.9.10 combined with BR section 7.1.2.5 prevents a CA from responding “good” for a precertificate. This is a problem because there is no guarantee that a certificate corresponding to a Precertificate has not been issued, resulting in root store policies such as \[2\] that require CAs to treat the existence of a Precertificate as a presumption that a corresponding certificate has been issued and thus that a valid OCSP response is required.

This ballot intends to resolve the problem by clarifying in the BRs that a CA may provide revocation information for the serial number contained in a Precertificate.
