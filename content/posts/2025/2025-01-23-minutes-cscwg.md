## Max validity reduction for Code Signing Certificates
Ian cannot join us this week, Nate (not Nick) will start attending the CSCWG next week, 2025-02-06 - at that time we can take up this topic again. No comments from the WG.
 
## Aligning the CSCWG BRs with recent ballots
Bruce still waiting on endorsers, the ballot needs one more endorser. Corey B. showed interest in the ballot but will need to review the text before endorsing.  Marco (IdenTrust) asked about the requirements to endorse the ballot.  Martijn explained that any voting member who agreed with the ballot could endorse.
 
## Cleanup Ballot
The word "effective" is used 17 times in the CSBRs, at least 12 are related to effective dates.  It should be ok to remove those terms and clean up the BRs before transitioning to a single profile.  Martijn was looking for someone to help him with this task - no immediate volunteers. Martijn will begin working on the cleanup ballot in the meantime.
 
## Moving towards a Single Profile CSBR
How best to do that?  Go through each section one by one or have someone present a complete proposal and then either accept or deny that? Corey suggests that we need to hear what Microsoft has to say about their requirements now that they are no longer making the EV distinction.  The CSCWG needs to know more about Microsoftâ€™s vision for Code Signing prior to making any changes to the profiles, since a strengthening to the "OV" model was mentioned at the announcement of EV deprecation. Bruce expressed concern that designing new validation methods without those high-level goals could be counterproductive.  Corey agreed. The topic will be revisited next week to allow Microsoft time to present an overview of their desired changes.
 
## Other Business
No other topics, next meeting 2025-02-06.
