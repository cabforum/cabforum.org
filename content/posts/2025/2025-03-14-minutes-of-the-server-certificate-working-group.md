## F2F#64 SCWG agenda

Dimitris noted that the agenda was discussed at the last meeting, and that there are 5 topics on the agenda, and invited feedback from members on those topics or additional topics. 

1. Clarify scope of TLS Baseline Requirements (Browser vs non-Browser use cases, websites accessible to the Internet vs websites accessible to specific networks, relationship with "WebPKI") (30-45 minutes)

2. Certificate Revocation: Is it effective at Internet scale? Browser requirements related to ongoing support of OCSP. (20-30 minutes)

3. Removal of id-kp-clientAuth KeyPurposeId from TLS server authentication certificates (20-30 minutes)

4. Ballot SC081: Introduce Schedule of Reducing Validity and Data Reuse Periods (20-30 minutes)

5. Classify GitHub open issues as "non-controversial" and seek volunteers (20-30 minutes)

Ryan Dickson commented that he hoped SC-081 could be moved earlier to allow adequate time for discussion, possibly after the TS BR scoping discussion, to resolve issues so that the ballot might move ahead.  This was supported by Chris Clements and Martijn Katerbarg. 

Ryan Dickson raised the topic of validation transparency (encoding the DCV method into the certificate content), and said that the topic was probably better suited to the Server Cert WG than the Validation subcommittee. Dimitris said that he would try to add this to the agenda.

Trevoli-Ponds White noted that there was time in the Forum agenda where a lawyer was speaking and this might be a source of time.

## Status of Ballots

Dimitris described the status of various ballots.

In Discussion Period

 - SC081v2: Introduce Schedule of Reducing Validity and Data Reuse Periods

Draft / Under Consideration

 - SC0XX: CA Assisted Domain Validation

 - SC0XX: DNSSEC Validation and RFC 8657 CAA Parameters

Aaron Gable noted that many CAs may have minor deviations from the way ACME is defined in RFC 8555 and ballot text should acknowledge this. Wayne Thayer agreed.

Clint Wilson noted that the DNSSEC ballot will likely move to ballot status soon. Dimitris said endorsers were sought.  Corey Bonnell said the Validation subcommittee would also have this on their agenda at the F2F.

## Any Other Business

Dimitris encouraged participants to register for the F2F.  He noted that there had been some changes in the wiki signups.
