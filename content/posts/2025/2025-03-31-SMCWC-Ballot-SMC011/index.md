## Ballot SMC011: Add EUID as Registration Reference

### Summary: 

This ballot allows the option to use a European Unique Identifier (EUID) as a Registration Reference in the NTR Registration Scheme.

The EUID uniquely identifies officially-registered organizations, Legal Entities, and branch offices within the European Union or the European Economic Area. The EUID is specified in chapter 9 of the Annex contained in the Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/1042 which describes rules for the application of Directive (EU) 2017/1132 "relating to certain aspects of company law (codification)".

The ballot also includes several editorial corrections (e.g., minor updates to References and regrouping of information from Appendix A to Section 7.1.4.2.2 (d)).

This ballot is proposed by Stephen Davidson (DigiCert) and endorsed by Adrian Mueller (SwissSign) and Adriano Santoni (Actalis).
