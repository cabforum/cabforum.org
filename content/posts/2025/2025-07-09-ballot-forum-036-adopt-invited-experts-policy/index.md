**Purpose of the Ballot FORUM-036: Adopt Invited Experts Policy**

This ballot is to establish a formal Invited Experts Policy and corresponding Agreement, drafted by the Forum’s IPR Subcommittee and modeled after the W3C's approach. These documents will enable the Forum to receive input from individuals with unique expertise or academic background who are not affiliated with member organizations, while ensuring transparency, consistency, and compliance with the Forum's IPR Policy. The proposed policy ensures appropriate vetting, limits conflicts of interest, and provides a structured, IPR-safe mechanism for receiving expert contributions on technical matters.

The ballot is proposed by Ben Wilson (Mozilla) and is endorsed by Chris Clements (Google Chrome) and Clint Wilson (Apple).
