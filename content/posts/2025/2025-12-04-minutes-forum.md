# Final Minutes of CA/B Forum meeting December 4, 2025
 
- Approval of minutes:
  - November 6th minutes: approved
  - F2F minutes: approved
- Server Certificate Working Group update (Dimitris): Summary of November 20th meetings. Basically: summary of the ballots, not much progress.
- Validation: no meeting last week.
- Code Signing Certificate Working Group update (Martijn): no updates. Next meeting next week.
- S/MIME Certificate Working Group update (Stephen): invited guests. SMIME BR has made improvement over time in the security of the ecosystem. Additional study: relatively high occurrence of key-reuse. Topic for 2026. Number of ballots for the new year, relating to pseudonyms and mobile driver licenses. Upcoming discussions: SMTP to SMTP, close enough to SMIME to find out what the problem is. Next steps to be determined.
- NetSec Working Group update (Clint): Not much discussion on the re-write, but next steps on cloud services. Very specific use cases, implementation guidance. No specific driver for that though.
- Definitions and Glossary Working Group (Tim H.): Waiting for resource to become available.
- Forum Infrastructure Subcommittee update (Jos): No update. Membership tools are down at the moment. This may delay sending out emails of recordings and minutes, just the automated ones.
- Any Other Business: Proposal for new Membership category. Action to put in a ballot – will put a draft ballot forward in the next week.
- Next call: Dec 18, 2025
