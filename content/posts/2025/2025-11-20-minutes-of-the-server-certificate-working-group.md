## Dimitris read the note well.


## Meeting minutes for November 6th were approved.


## Dimitris provided the current ballot status (as indicated in agenda).

The status for ballots under consideration was provided by various members:

1. Corey said SC-87 will be moving again soon now that SC-86 passed.

2. Rich said that there are a few aspects that are being discussed on the ADN ballot and will revert soon. Aaron said there was good discussion on the validation call last week. Since then, the draft ballot has been updated to allow CNAME-then-prune for DNS-based validation and increase readability using tables.

3. Martijn said that Aaron and Corey provided feedback on the revocation requirements improvement ballot. He asked for more reviews.

4. Clint said that he's waiting for the queue of ballots to be processed before proceeding with the "validation method in certificates" ballot. He said that he is still considering feedback from Corey.

5. Dimitris said he will circulate a ballot next week for discussion to exempt DNSSEC validation for email-based validation methods, as discussed on the mailing list and at the F2F. He said that there are already two endorsers. Aaron asked if the ballot will also exempt CNAME lookups from DNSSEC validation for email-based validation. Dimitris said that DNSSEC validation in this case is fine. The intent of the ballot is only exempt MX record lookups from DNSSEC validation.

6. Dimitris said that the Asseco team has been working on the 2025 cleanup ballot. He said he will follow up with the Asseco team on next steps.

Dimitris said that it's not necessary to sequence ballots and it is possible to have multiple ballots running at the same time.

There is no other business.
