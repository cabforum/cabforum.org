Ballot SMC013: Enable PQC Algorithms for S/MIME 

Summary: 

This ballot introduces specifications for the use of two post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, as standardized by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in the S/MIME BR:

* ML-DSA, or Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm, a digital signature scheme; and

* ML-KEM, or Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism, a key encapsulation mechanism.

The ballot specifies single-key/non-hybrid PQC certificates that do not rely upon pre-quantum algorithms. 

The ballot is intended to enable experimentation by Certificate Issuers with PQC certificates; noting that additional requirements on the use of PQC may be imposed by Root programs. 

This ballot is proposed by Stephen Davidson (DigiCert) and endorsed by Andreas Henschel (D-Trust) and Martijn Katerbarg (Sectigo).
