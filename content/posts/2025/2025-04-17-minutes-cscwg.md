Corey mentions that once that registration is in place. He can restart CSC-29 as CSC-30 with no changed except a later effective date.
 
## Maximum validity of CS certificates
Microsoft wants to move forward on this ballot. Nate has discussed internally and is proposing an effective date 12 month in the future from when the ballot will be started.
Nate will start off the ballot, the working group has offered assistance where needed. 
 
## PQC ballot

No updates yet from Microsoft on this topic.
 
## Any Other Business
Marco raises is the CSCWG needs to consider MPIC. It's brought forward that there is no direct DCV or CAA requirements for code signing certificates, thus there not being a use for MPIC.
