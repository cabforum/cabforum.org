## Working Group Updates

- Validation Subcommittee (Corey Bonnell): The group discussed definitions for "Authorization Domain Name," "Base Domain Name," and CNAME chaining. A future ballot will be drafted to clarify these terms. The next meeting will cover IP address-based validation and F2F meeting topics.
- Code Signing WG (Martijn Katerbarg): Ballot CSC-31 is in discussion and will be restarted soon with minor changes.
- S/MIME WG (Martijn Katerbarg): The last meeting was dominated by a discussion on the use of pseudonyms in the Common Name, with differing opinions. A discussion was also held on potentially re-allowing the OU field in S/MIME certificates.
- NetSec WG (Clint Wilson): The group had a brief discussion on the potential use of AI as a tool for monitoring incidents, ballots, and certificate validation workflows. Clint suggested this is a broader Forum-level topic.
- Definitions & Glossary WG (Tim Hollebeek): Work is resuming to create a standalone definitions document and resolve circular references. Ballots are being organized.
- Forum Infrastructure WG (Ben Wilson): The group discussed GitHub governance, including the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and comment moderation. They concluded that these are policy decisions for the full Forum.
- IPR Subcommittee (Ben Wilson): A final redlined draft of the IPR Policy v1.4 is complete and will be circulated to the public list for review.
