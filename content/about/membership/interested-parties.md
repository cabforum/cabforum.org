The role of the Interested Party in CA/B Forum activities is described in Section 3.2 of the [Bylaws][1]. An Interested Party may post to a Forum Working Groupâ€™s public mailing list and participate in teleconferences to which they are invited by the Working Group Chair related to their area of expertise or to the subject of their working group participation.
