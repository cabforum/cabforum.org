[**Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy v. 1.3**][1] **– effective 3 July 2018**

[**CAB Forum Agreement for IPR Policy v.1.3**][2]

[**CAB Forum Invited Experts Policy**][11]

[**CAB Forum Invited Experts Agreement**][12]

The CA/Browser Forum’s IPR Policy governs Contributions by members of the Forum during the drafting and adoption process of Normative Requirements by a Working Group. A Contribution is any material “made verbally or in a tangible form of expression (including in electronic media) which is provided by a Participant in the process of developing a Draft Guideline for the purpose of incorporating such material into a Draft Guideline or a Final Guideline or Final Maintenance Guideline.” The term “Draft Guideline” includes ballots that are being considered for adoption by a Working Group as either a “Final Guideline” or a “Final Maintenance Guideline”.

When a ballot to amend an existing Final Guideline is adopted by a Working Group, that amendment is considered a Final Maintenance Guideline, and each of the above guideline documents, as amended, is then considered a “Final Guideline” of the CA/Browser Forum.

Each of the following documents is considered a “Final Guideline”:

[EV TLS Certificate Guidelines][3]

[TLS Baseline Requirements][4]

[Network and Certificate System Security Requirements][5]

[Code Signing Baseline Requirements][9]

[S/MIME Baseline Requirements][10]
