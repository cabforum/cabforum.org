## Membership Requirements

There are four categories of members in the Code Signing Working Group:

1. **Certificate Issuers:** Certificate Authorities that issue publicly trusted code signing certificates. This group can attend all meetings and vote in the working group.
1. **Certificate Consumers:** This refers to platforms (OS or other) that “consume” code signing certificates to make decisions about the code signed by the certificate. This group can attend all meetings and vote in the working group.
1. **Interested Parties:** Anyone that has an interest in participating in the working group. This group can attend all telephone meetings but cannot vote. They can be invited to face to face meetings by the Chair.
1. **Associate Members:** Organizations that add value to the working group as determined by the group. Traditionally these have been organizations such as WebTrust, ETSI, Federal PKI, and ICANN (see: [/about/membership/associate-members/](/about/membership/associate-members/) ). Recently this category has been expanded to include organizations that intend to be in categories 1 or 2 but have not completed all the required steps. This group can attend all meetings but cannot vote.

**IN ALL CATEGORIES, EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE IPR AGREEMENT IS MANDATORY, PER THE CA/BROWSER FORUM BYLAWS (See: [/about/ipr-policy/](/about/ipr-policy/))**
