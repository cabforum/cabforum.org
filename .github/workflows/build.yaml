  # Rebuild the website daily using a cron job. Alternatively, we could use a 
  # repository_dispatch event and a workflow on the working group repositories that \
  # triggers this webhook whenever there is a push to the main branch, a pull request
  # (with labels) is created or updated, and so on. This would allow changes to be 
  # visible faster. However, this also requires taking into account the frequency of 
  # pull request updates and avoiding excessive rebuilds.

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# If a deployment is cancelled midway, it could potentially leave the website in an unstable state, this is not an issue for pull requests that do not get deployed.
