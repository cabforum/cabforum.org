## Relevant Bylaw references

Bylaw 2.3(6) requires:

- a "yes" vote by two-thirds of Certificate Issuer votes and 50%-plus-one Certificate Consumer votes for approval.  Votes to abstain are not counted for this purpose. This requirement was met for both Certificate Issuers and Certificate Consumers.
- at least one Certificate Issuer and one Certificate Consumer Member must vote in favor of a ballot for the ballot to be adopted. This requirement was also met.

Under Bylaw 2.3(7), "a ballot result will be considered valid only when more than half of the number of currently active Members has participated". Votes to abstain are counted in determining a quorum. Half of currently active Members as of the start of voting was **XX**, so quorum was **XX votes** â€“ _quorum was met_.
